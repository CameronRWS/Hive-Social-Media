Curl tests... Trying to learn how this works...

POST (create a new post)
curl -d '{"hiveId":"3", "userId":"3", "dateCreated":"ok", "textContent":"example post"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/posts


PUT (update a posts text content - doesn't check credentials since userId is not provided)
curl -d '{"textContent":"this is some text2"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:8080/posts/5


PUT (update a posts text content - checks credentials)
curl -d '{"userId":"100","textContent":"this is some text2"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:8080/posts/5
